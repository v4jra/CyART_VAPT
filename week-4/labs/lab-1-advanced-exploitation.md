# Lab 1 – Advanced Exploitation

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to simulate advanced exploitation scenarios involving exploit chaining, custom proof-of-concept development, and binary analysis. The lab focused on understanding how multiple vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve remote code execution.

---

## Scope
- Exploitation of vulnerable web applications
- Analysis of binaries for memory corruption
- Understanding modern mitigation bypass concepts

---

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Python
- Ghidra
- Nmap

---

## Enumeration
Initial enumeration was performed using Nmap to identify open services and vulnerable applications. Web application enumeration revealed outdated plugins and misconfigurations suitable for exploitation.

---

## Exploitation
A multi-stage exploitation chain was executed, starting with a client-side vulnerability and leading to remote code execution.

| Exploit ID | Description | Target | Status | Payload |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| 007 | XSS to RCE Chain | VulnHub VM | Success | Meterpreter |

---

## Binary Analysis (Ghidra)
Ghidra was used to statically analyze a vulnerable binary. The analysis helped identify unsafe function usage and understand program control flow. This examination supported exploit development concepts and mitigation awareness.

---

## Impact
Successful exploitation resulted in unauthorized system access, demonstrating the risks posed by outdated software and weak input validation.

---

## Recommendations
- Regularly update web applications and plugins
- Perform secure code reviews
- Enable exploit mitigation protections
